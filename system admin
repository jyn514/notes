File systems:

EXT4 most common
ZFS - 'smart file system'
    makes copies adn snapshots

NFS - Network File System
    e.g. /acct

RAID (fancy) - Redundant Array of Independent Disks
    Combines multiple physical disks to logical disk
    Levels:
        Linear - concatenate (treat as larger disk)
        0 - striping    (faster I/O, useless if one fails)
        1 - mirroring   (Redundant, all but one can fail)
        5 - striping with distributed parity (?)
        6 - P + Q redundancy (2 disks can fail)
    Hardware and Software; hardware faster
    
Swap
    Speed difference:
    CPU - clock speed, usually gigahertz
    RAM - 1000x slower
    Disk - 1000000x slower
    
Network config:
    IP address (UID)
    Public vs. private ip
    DHCP - dynamic host config protocol (dynamic ips)
    MAC address (UUID)
    CDMA (telephony (?))
