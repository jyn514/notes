(Mostly) Useless algorithms
by Noel Raley

Radix sort (by least significant digit)
    continue with next least significant digits
    linear by size of largest element
    
Dayley sort / Counting sort
    Written by Raley and Day
    1. Create array of size max
    2. Put each number at that index
    3. remove empty spots
Done!

Sleep sort
    wait x milliseconds
    print x
    
Succ sort
    copy = array.copy
    while ( max >= 0 ) 
        for i = 0 to max
            if copy[i] > copy[i] + 1 // integer overflow
                swap copy[i] with copy[max]
                swap array[i] with array[max]
                max--
            else
                copy[i]++
