Driver uses layer 1 (bits)
Switches use layer 2 (mac addresses)
Routers use layer 3 (ip addresses) (also known as gateway), usually 192.168.1.1 on subnet on 255.255.255.0

*must* have gateway to cross layer 3 boundaries; otherwise can use switch
(line between switch and routers blurred in modern net)

Routers -> switches -> commputers

multicast (to any device on same router)

firewalls:
usually behind router
alows blocking of certain ports, subnets, etc
ID by port doesn't work anymore (skype uses 443, etc); need to look at IP address, behavior, url
as general rule, only allow expected traffic

Client firewalls: iptables
-F (flush)
-P protocol [INPUT|FORWARD|OUTPUT] [DROP|ALLOW]
-s source
Block all from certain address: iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.5 -j DROP 

home routers are usually combination of router, switch, and WAP


IPV4: most widely used TCP/IP suite
uses 32-bit addresses (2^32 = 4294967296 addresses)
first address (usually) gateway, last address always broadcast (sends to all on network)
Have run out of public ip addresses. (need to use NAT)
routers usually have different address for each subnetwork (ie. 192.168.[0/1].1 for 2 subnets) 
.0 defines the network

if address unknown (e.g. public address), set to gateway upstream (default gateway)
DNS servers do the same thing
can put rules for computers that don't exist

Content caching: multiple servers hosting, DNS gives you the closest
can also do 'IP load-balancing'

NAT (network address translation):
    dependent because not enough public addresses
    1 public leads to multiple private
    PAT (different ports lead to different private addresses)
    router can rewrite port number to see which private address it came from

DNS:
    NS record for domains (example.com NS ns1.somedomain.com)
    A record: name A <ipv4>
    AAA: name AAAA <ipv6>
    CNAME alias: example.com CNAME example.net
    MX: gmail.com MX <priority #>  mail.google.com
    PTR: opposite of A

ICMP - layer 4 network request - field type 8


DHCP dynamic host control protocol


<ip>/24 - mask is 255.255.255.0 (genmask or netmask)
32 means all masked (true IP address)
Route summarization - ^ mask is subnet
every subnet burns 3 addresses: net address, gateway, broadcast

route commands:
ip route show
route add default gw 192.168.0.1 <interface>
ip route add <subnet> via <gateway>


More iptables examples:
No connections:
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
ACCEPT  all -- anywhere
Chain FORWARD(policy DROP)
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)

ONLY port 80 io:
Chain INPUT (policy drop)
ACCEPT tcp dpt:http
ACCEPT udp dpt:domain
